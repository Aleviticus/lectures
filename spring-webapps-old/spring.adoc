= Spring -- An application framework
:imagesdir: images

The Spring Framework footnoteref:[spring, Spring - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework[Wikipedia]] is an open-source, general purpose, Java-based application framework.
Parts of it can be used as a library but at the very core of it it's an inversion-of-controlfootnoteref:[ioc, Inversion of Control - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control[Wikipedia]] container which allows you to write easy to test application components.

Beyond that it provides means to apply technical services (e.g. transactions and security) in a declarative and portable way, integrations with persistence and integration technologies as well as an MVC web framework.

As a developer you usually use Spring Framework through Spring Boot, which is an opinionated add-on to automatically configure and ease the set up of a Spring based application so that you can focus on your business codefootnoteref:[spring, Philosophies that Shaped Successful Frameworks - http://www.capitalone.io/blog/successful-framework-philosophies/[Blog post]].

[[spring.ioc]]
== Inversion of Control
Inversion of Control (otherwise also referred to as Dependency Injection) is the software design technique that frees a component from the task to look up its collaborators and rather get those handed into the component – usually as constructor arguments.
This inverts the control of this lookup from the component itself to its context (hence the name).
The assembly of a component is externalized and usually taken care of by a generic framework but can -- and almost always is -- also be used manually e.g. in test cases.

This approach especially improves testability of components as the collaborators that would be used in a production environment can easily be replaced with test components.

[[spring.building-blocks]]
== Fundamental building blocks of a Spring Boot application

* *Application code* -- code you write, e.g. the `WelcomeController` in the quick start example.
* *Configuration* -- code to configure the application container. Declares references to infrastructure components (e.g. the database, security) and defines how application components are found:
+
.An example configuration class
====
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
class Application {

  public static void main(String... args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }
}
----
====

This is the primary application class (hence the name) and uses `SpringApplication.run(…)` in the main method to start a Spring `ApplicationContext` and inspect the given configuration, the `Application` class itself in this case.

The `@SpringBootApplication` is the annotation to enable very fundamental features of Spring boot. It actually acts like a combination of the following three annotations:

* `@Configuration` -- Declares the class to contain configuration. This will cause the container to detect methods annotated with `@Bean` for you to provide custom components manually.
* `@EnableAutoConfiguration` -- Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration features to activate features based on your classpath setup.
* `@ComponentScan` -- Activates the detection of Spring components for the package of the annotated class.

Thus, using the single annotation, all of these features get activated at application startup.

[[spring.bootstrap]]
== Running a Spring Boot application

The application containing a main method, makes it very easy to start it from within the IDE as the class itself becomes executable.
That's very convenient during development.
However, there are a couple of more ways we might want to execute the application: packaged into an executable, so that we can actually run it on a production server, and during integration test execution to verify its behavior.

[[spring.bootstrap.standalone]]
=== Standalone

* On the command line, run `mvn clean package` and run the JAR (Java application ARchive) using `java -jar target/*.jar`.
You can basically take the JAR created by the build and run that on any machine that has Java installed.

WARNING: Don't be trapped by trying to use your IDE's JAR export mechanism.
It's crucial for the application to work as a standalone JAR to be built using the the actual build mechanism, which applies the necessary plugins to make the JAR bootable.

[[spring.bootstrap.integration-tests]]
=== In integration tests

* One of the most common ways of executing Test cases is with an open-source library called http://junit.org[JUnit] which has both Maven and Eclipse integration.
* To bootstrap the application container in an integration test the test class has to look as follows:
+
.Bootstrapping the Spring container from an integration test
====
[source, java]
----
@SpringBootTest
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
class ApplicationTests { … }
----
====
* `@SpringBootTest` expresses Boot to be used during tests. The main configuration class will be auto-detected looking for a class with an `@SpringBootApplication` in the current package and all above.
* `@RunWith(…)` tells JUnit to give Spring Framework the control over the test execution.

[[spring.application-components]]
== Application components

Application components are usually identified by an annotation that is either `@Component` or an annotation which is annotated with `@Component` in turn (e.g. `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`).
The component classes are discovered at bootstrap time and a single instance is created.
+
.A simple application component
====
[source, java]
----
@Component
class MyApplicationComponent {}
----
====

If a component needs other components to work with (e.g. the web controller needs access to the component implementing data access), the component required can be injected into the depending component by declaring a constructor taking a dependency of the necessary type.

.A simple component with a dependency
====
[source, java]
----
@Component
class MyDependingComponent {

  private final MyApplicationComponent dependency;

  public MyDependingComponent(MyApplicationComponent dependency) {
    this.dependency = dependency;
  }
}
----
====

If a component depended on cannot be found in the container, an exception is thrown:

.A Spring exception indicating a component cannot be found
====
----
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type [demo.MyApplicationComponent] found for dependency: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency. Dependency annotations: {}

When using STS, classes that are Spring components carry a little S-overlay on the icon:
