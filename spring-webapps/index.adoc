This documents summarizes the content of a lecture I held at TU Dresden in support of the Software Engineering Lab.
Its primary goal is to ramp up the students with the very basics of Java web application development.
If you're looking for the script used in years 2014 and 2015, it's been relocated to link:../../lectures/spring-webapps-old/[here].

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The fundamental goals of the lecture are:

* Learn how a web application works fundamentally
* Learn how you'd implement a web application using Spring MVC

The lecture content is three-fold: we're going to start by looking at how a web application works fundamentally.
Having identified the most crucial aspects of that, we're going to explore how to use Spring MVC to implement those aspects using Spring MVC.
We're then going to have a look at how to integrate business code with the code we wrote for the web handling.

Once that's done we're exploring what the Guestbook sample applicationfootnote:[Guestbook sample application -- https://github.com/st-tu-dresden/guestbook[GitHub repository]] consists of.
We're then going to cover aspects of Spring Data JPA to implement persistence and Spring MVC for the web layer.

The source document for this script can be found in https://github.com/odrotbohm/lectures[this GitHub repository]. Feel free to create tickets for improvements or provide patches via pull requests.

[[understanding-the-web]]
== Fundamentals of the web

Objective: understanding the building blocks of the web to a degree that it allows you to understand how a browser interacts with a server.

* Biggest distributed network ever built (REST -> Roy Fielding's https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm[dissertation])
* Browser -> Request (Header, Body)-> Server
* Server -> Response (typically HTML, JSON) -> Clients interprets response
* Resources, URI, uniform interface (HTTP methods)

[[handling-web-requests]]
== Handling web requests with Spring MVC

* MVC in the web: Model, View, Controller
* Model: data to be presented, a certain view on the domain model of the server.
* View: a template to describe the representation (usually using some mechanism for dynamic composition)
* Controller: a piece of code that translates HTTP requests into the calls to the actual business logic

[[handling-web-requests.request]]
=== Mapping a request

First thing we have to take care of is that a web request actually triggers some of our code is actually invoked.
To achieve that Spring MVC provides a variety of annotations to allow us to define for which requests a method should be called.

[title="Mapping a request"]
====
[source, java, title="`MyController.java` in package `example` under `src/main/java`"]
----
@Controller <1>
class MyController {

  @GetMapping("/hello") <2>
  void myMethod(@RequestParam Optional<String> name) {} <3>
}
----
<1> As the name suggests , the `@Controller` annotation declares the class to be a controller.
This will cause Spring MVC to create an instance of that class and inspect it for request mapping annotations so that it can route incoming requests to them.
<2> Maps the method to a particular request. I.e. if a request is matching the configuration, the method will be called.
<3> Annotated parameters to access parts of the request, in this case a request parameter named `name`.
====

Declaring a class like just seen will cause our method to be called for `GET` requests to `/hello`.
The method will receive the `name` request parameter wrapped into an `Optional` if the parameter was present in the request.
If no parameter named `name` was present, the method will receive `Optional.empty()`.

Next, we'll have to create a response to answer that request.

[[handling-web-requests.response]]
=== Creating a response

Again the framework is helping us here by doing all the heavy lifting for us.
In an MVC context, a response is usually created by using a so called template, which -- as we'd like to take a simple step here -- can be a static HTML page.

[title="The controller selecting a view"]
====
[source, java]
----
@Controller
class MyController {

  @GetMapping("/hello")
  String myMethod(@RequestParam Optional<String> name) { <1>
    return "hello"; <2>
  }
}
----
[source,html, title="`template/hello.html` in `src/main/resources`"]
----
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
    <title>Hello!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
----
<1> The method signature has been changed to return a `String` now.
<2> The method returns a logical name to select a view. The simple `hello` will be translated into a lookup of a file under `templates/hello.html` (usually placed in `src/main/resources`).
====

[[handling-web-requests.model]]
=== Using a model

Let's say we'd want refer to the name provided as request parameter from within the view template.
The "communication" between controller and view is achieved using a model.
Spring MVC provides a programmatic abstraction for that which can be accessed by just declaring `Model` as controller method parameter.

[title="Populating the model"]
====
[source, java]
----
@Controller
class MyController {

  @GetMapping("/hello")
  String myMethod(@RequestParam Optional<String> name, Model model) { <1>

    model.addAttribute("name", name.orElse("World")); <2>

    return "hello";
  }
}
----
<1> Framework provides access to the model if we declare a corresponding method parameter.
<2> We can then populate the model by adding an attribute named `name` to it.
As the request parameter can be absent, we default it to `World` here.
====

NOTE: Find an overview about all supported annotations https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-methods[here] and http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/must-know-spring-boot-annotations-controllers/[here].

[source,html]
----
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"> <1>
  <head>
    <title>Hello!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 th:text="${'Hello, ' + name + '!'}">Hello!</h1> <2>
  </body>
</html>
----
<1> We register an XML namespace for Thymeleaf, a template engine that allows us to enrich our previously static template with dynamic parts.
All elements and attributes from the `th`-namespace will be processed by the template engine and replace the content of the elements that carry the attributes.

[[handling-web-requests.business-logic]]
=== Invoking business logic

* Architecture: web layer -> business layer -> persistence

Let's make this practical. Assume we'd want to treat one particular name in a special way.
A na√Øve approach might be to implement that particular logic directly in the controller.

[title="Adding business logic"]
====
[source, java]
----
@Controller
class MyController {

  @GetMapping("/hello")
  String myMethod(@RequestParam Optional<String> name, Model model) {

    var whoToGreet = name
      .map(it -> it.equals("TU Dresden") ? it.concat(", yay") : it) <1>
      .orElse("World");

    model.addAttribute("name", whoToGreet);

    return "hello";
  }
}
----
<1> We treat `TU Dresden` given as name by effectively turning it into a `TU Dresden, yay`
====

What's the problem with this?
We're starting to intermingle different concerns here: we're mixing request handling (mapping the request, accessing the request parameter) and response preparing logic (populating the model) with the actual business logic.
But why is this a problem?
The more concerns we mix together, the harder it will become to actually test certain aspects of the application.
Assume, we only wanted to test that `TU Dresden` gets translated into `TU Dresden, yay`.
The test code would have to look something like this:

[title="A unit test for a Spring MVC controller"]
====
[source, java, title="`MyControllerUnitTest.java` in package `example` under `src/test/java`"]
----
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.*;

class MyControllerUnitTests {

  @Test
  void augmentsYayToTuDresden() {

    var controller = new MyController();

    var model = new ExtendedModelMap();
    controller.myMethod(Optional.of("TU Dresden"), model);

    assertThat(model.asMap().get("name")).isEqualTo("TU Dresden, yay");
  }
}
----
====

We basically have to mimic the frameworks behavior here and can only test the actual business logic in an indirect way.
We have to prepare a `Model` instance, which requires knowledge about the framework.
We invoke the method just like the framework.
And finally, we have to know about the key that we use to populate the model.
Sure we could use a constant here but let's try something different and see how this affects both the controller implementation and the test code.

Let's extract the actual business logic into a separate class:

[title="Extracting business logic into a dedicated class"]
====
[source, java, title="`Greeter.java` in package `example` under `src/main/java`"]
----
class Greeter {

  String greet(String input) {

    Assert.hasText(input, "Input must not be null or empty!");

    return input.equals("TU Dresden") ? input.concat(", yay") : input;
  }
}
----
====

This piece of code is way more precise as it leaves all web related artifacts away.
It's pure business logic: verify the input actually has text and perform our business logic on it.
So, what would a test for the business logic implemented like this look like?

[title="A unit test for the business logic"]
====
[source, java, title="`GreeterUnitTests.java` in package `example` under `src/test/java`"]
----
class GreeterUnitTests {

  @Test
  void augmentsYayToTuDresden() {

    var greeter = new Greeter();

    assertThat(greeter.greet("TU Dresden")).isEqualTo("TU Dresden, yay");
  }
}
----
====

Note, how the code has become significantly simpler as we don't have to deal with the framework APIs at all.

How do we actually integrate the functionality extracted into the `Greeter` class into the controller.
If we want to call the method on `Greeter`, we need to make sure the controller gets an instance of it.
That means, the controller has a dependency on `Greeter` -- the former cannot work without the latter.
A dependency of a class is expressed by creating a constructor taking the dependency as argument.
We keep the reference around in a field, so that we can use it in the method.

[title="Using the `Greeter` in the controller"]
====
[source, java]
----
@Controller
class MyController {

  private final Greeter greeter; <1>

  MyController(Greeter greeter) { <2>
    this.greeter = greeter;
  }

  @GetMapping("/hello")
  String myMethod(@RequestParam Optional<String> name, Model model) {

    var whoToGreet = name.map(it -> greeter.greet(it)).orElse("World"); <3>

    model.addAttribute("name", whoToGreet); <4>

    return "hello";
  }
}
----
<1> A field to keep the dependency around and to be able to refer to it from within the method.
<2> A constructor to express the dependency.
<3> Using the `Greeter` to access the business logic implemented in it.
<4> Add result to the model.
====

If we try to run this piece of code, the application will fail to start and express it cannot create an instance of `MyController` as it doesn't know about a `Greeter`.

2016-10-18 12:48:21.468 ERROR 3188 --- [  restartedMain] o.s.b.d.LoggingFailureAnalysisReporter   :

***************************
APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

Parameter 0 of constructor in example.MyController required a bean of type 'example.Greeter' that could not be found.


Action:

Consider defining a bean of type 'example.Greeter' in your configuration.
----

Why is that?
Remember that Spring will create instances of the classes it knows about?
It knows about the controller class, as it is annotated with `@Controller`.
It discovers the constructor and realizes, it needs a `Greeter` first.
However, `Greeter` isn't under Spring's control yet as we haven't expressed that it's supposed to be managed by Spring yet.
We can fix this by annotating with `@Component`.

[title="Tuning `Greeter` into a Spring bean"]
====
[source, java, title="Greeter.java"]
----
@Component <1>
class Greeter {

  String greet(String input) {

    Assert.hasText(input, "Input must not be null or empty!");

    return input.equals("TU Dresden") ? input.concat(", yay") : input;
  }
}
----
<1> The `@Component` annotation will make the class known to Spring and available for injection into other Spring beans.
====
During the next bootstrap, the following will happen:

1. Spring scans your application and it will find both `MyController` and `Greeter` as they're both annotated.
2. Spring will discover that -- for a `MyComponent` instance to be created -- it needs a `Greeter` instance first.
3. Spring creates the `Greeter` instance.
4. Spring creates the `MyComponent` instance by handing the just created `Greeter` instance to the constructor.

Effectively, what Spring does is roughly equivalent to this snippet of code:

[source, java]
----
var greeter = new Greeter();
var controller = new MyController(greeter);
----

The concept of exposing a required dependency as constructor parameter and some code (framework or manually written) handing in instances of those dependencies is called Inversion of Control.
