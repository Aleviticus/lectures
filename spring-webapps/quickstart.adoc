[[quickstart.objectives]]
== Objectives

* Learn how to create, setup and run a Java based web project
* Learn how to handle a web request
* Learn how to efficiently work with web related code

[[quickstart.create-project]]
== Create a new project

.IDE centric style

1. Start STS.
2. Create a new project menu:File[New… > Other] (or kbd:[⌘+N]).
3. Select "Spring Starter Project".
4. Keep settings (details on that below).
5. Select "Web" in the Dependencies matrix.
6. Select btn:[Finish].

.Manual version

1. Browse to http://start.spring.io.
2. Keep settings (details on them below).
3. Select "Web" in the Dependencies matrix.
4. Select btn:[Generate project].
5. Open up your IDE.
6. In Eclipse select menu:File[Import…].
7. Select "Existing Maven Projects".

.The result
The result should be a Java project created in the IDE looking something like this:

image::project.png[]

What do we have here?

* `Application.java` in `src/main/java` - The main (startable) application class.
* `static` / `templates` folders in `src/main/resources` - Folders for static resources and view templates.
* `application.properties` - Configuration file.
* `ApplicationTests.java` - Integration test to test the application.
* `pom.xml` - The POM (Project Object Model). A Maven configuration file to control project setup, build and dependencies.

[[quickstart.minimal-functionality]]
== Add minimal functionality and run this thing

* Create a new class, e.g. in the `demo` package: Select `src/main/java`, press kbd:[⌥+⌘+N], type `Class` or select menu:File[New… > Class] to bring up the new class wizard. Enter `demo` for the package name, `WelcomeController` as type name. Edit the created class to look like this:
+
.A simple Spring MVC controller
====
[source, java]
----
@RestController <1>
class WelcomeController {

  @RequestMapping("/welcome") <2>
  String welcome() {
    return "Welcome"; <3>
  }
}
----
<1> Causes the class to be found by the Spring container and turned into a Spring bean. This is not directly caused by `@RestController` but the annotation being meta-annotated with `@Controller` which is in turn annotated with `@Component`. See more on that in <<spring.building-blocks>>.
<2> Maps `/welcome` to the execution of the annotated method. All HTTP request to that URI will cause the method to be invoked.
<3> The result to be written to the response. Using `@RestController` causes the `String` returned to be considered the response payload.
====

[NOTE]
====
When pasting this code into your IDE it might already import the right types for you. In case it doesn't and you see red underlines e.g. under `@RestController` you have a variety of options:

* Navigate to right after `@RestController` and hit kbd:[⌃+Space]. This will trigger code completion suggestions and either provide you with a drop down list to choose the type from (in case multiple ones matching what you typed are on the classpath).
* Alternatively try kbd:[⌘+⇧+O] (Organize imports), which should try to resolve the type tokens you used.
====

* Execute `Application.java` (kbd:[⌥+⌘+X],kbd:[J] or right click the class, menu:Run As[Java Application]).
* Browse to http://localhost:8080/welcome, should give you `Welcome`.

TIP: Try using kbd:[⌘+Space] while typing here and there. Eclipse will usually provide you quite useful suggestions for code completion.

[[quickstart.dynamics]]
== Make this a bit more dynamic

TIP: If you run the application in debug mode, you can change method bodies on the fly without having to restart the app. We're going to use that mode going forward.

* Change the method signature of the controller method to this:
+
[source, java]
----
welcome(@RequestParam(value = "name") Optional<String> name)
----

* Restart the application in debug mode (kbd:[⇧+⌥+D],kbd:[J] or menu:Debug As[Java Application]).
* Browse to `http://localhost:8080/welcome`, output should be unchanged.
* Change the URI to `http://localhost:8080/welcome?name=Java`, doesn't have any effect yet.
* While the application is running, change the method body to:
+
[source, java]
----
return "Welcome ".concat(name.orElse("World")).concat("!");
----

* Refresh the browser tab and the response should now adapt to changes of the `name` attribute.
